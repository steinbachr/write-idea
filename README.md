==========

A tool for spicing up the process of daily writing with random words as fetched from Merriam Webster. Hint: The way I use this tool is to challenge myself to use each of the fetched words in my day's writing.


Prequisites
============
BeautifulSoup4 is required and can be installed from [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4)


Usage
========
The tool is called by simply executing the shell script
```
./journal.sh
```

Optionally, the script can also be executed with a parameter for the name of a file to append the words of the day to.
```
./journal.sh my_journal.txt
```


Enjoy and happy writing!
